# lingua-loop

LinguaLoop bundles my transcription-focused technique for learning languages
into a single page web application. Here's how you use the app:

1. Select the target language you want to study.
2. Copy and paste a youtube video corresponding to that target language.
   Ideally, the video should have **official** transcripts since those will be
   used as the reference for scoring your transcription attempt.
3. Listen to the video in small segments (e.g., 10 second segments) and
   to type what you think you hear. You may listen as many times as you want.
4. Once you have made an honest attempt, you can submit your transcription
   attempt and will receive a score from 0 to 1. A score of 1 indicates a
   perfect transcription and a score of 0 indicates a complete mismatch.
5. Repeat for as long as desired.

The scoring algorithm uses [Gestalt pattern
matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_pattern_matching), which
essentially matches the longest common series of characters. For example, if
you type "wikim$$\color{red}an$$ia" but the official transcrit has
"wikim$$\color{red}ed$$ia", you would receive a score of 0.70 because, despite
the error, there are common characters that you correctly typed.

# Future Work

Some possible extension ideas:

1. Integrate Anki-style flash cards for selected words. A word should be added
   to a flash card deck in addition to the context in which it occurred (e.g.,
   sentence or phrase). The user *should* write additional context to keep them
   actively engaged in the learning process.
2. Support more languages. Currently only Indo-european languages are
   supported, though support for languages such as Mandarin would be extremely
   valuable. For Mandarin, I think text normalization would require
   [pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin)
3. More sophisticated scoring algorithms.
4. Integrate an AI chat bot that is given the full transcript as context and
   subsequently asks the user comprehension questions or engages in
   conversation about the video topic. Could be executed using local models
   or combined with API keys.

# Developers

The directory structure is inspired by a number of projects, so it is
intended to be as standard and intuitive as possible:

```

The fast package manger `uv` was used in the development of this project.
You can install `lingua-loop` in development mode by doing the following:

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:jfdev001/lingua-loop.git
$ cd lingua-loop
$ uv sync
```

Extensive testing for the FastAPI backend is available and you should
verify the tests pass on your machine:

```shell
$ pytest -v tests/
```

You should also make sure that your files are formatted according to
the conventions defined in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. To that end, use
the fast git hook runner framework [prek](https://github.com/j178/prek):

```
$ prek install
```

There are tests to verify the outputs of the `youtube_transcript_api`
dependency, however, these make requests to YouTube, and are therefore *not*
run by default. You can run those tests if you want by including the `--slow`
flag like

```shell
$ pytest -v --slow tests/
```

If you'd like to contribute, consider opening an issue or addressing one
of the issues already available. You should fork the project first before
contributing. Pull requests should come from branches with the following
structure:

```
<name>/<issue-number-if-applicable>-<feature-description>
```
